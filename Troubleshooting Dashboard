To check if ModSecurity rule **941110** is disabled inside your Docker container, you typically want to:

1. **Access the Docker container running your WAF (Apache + ModSecurity).**
2. **Check if the rule is commented out or otherwise disabled in the relevant rules file(s).**
3. Or, if your setup keeps track of disabled rules in a JSON state file inside the container, check that file.

---

### Step-by-step to check from Docker CLI:

Assuming your container is named `waf` (or replace with your container name):

```bash
docker exec -it waf /bin/bash
```

Once inside the container shell:


# Check if the rule is disabled by searching for 941110 in rules files (commented out)
grep -r --include="*.conf" "941110" /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules | grep "^#"

# Or simply grep the rule in rules files:
grep -r --include="*.conf" "id:941110" /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules

grep -r --include="*.conf" "id:941100" /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules
```

If the rule is **commented out** (lines starting with `#`), then it's disabled.

---

### Check your persistent rule state JSON file inside container:

```bash
cat /etc/modsecurity/persistent/rule_state.json | grep 941110 -A 5
```

If the rule ID `941110` appears there, it means it is recorded as disabled by your script.

---

### Quick one-liner from host (replace `waf` with your container name):

```bash
docker exec waf grep -r --include="*.conf" "941110" /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules | grep "^#"
docker exec waf cat /etc/modsecurity/persistent/rule_state.json | grep 941110 -A 5
```
